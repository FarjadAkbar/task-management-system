## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security bugs seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings, and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

### How to Report

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them via email to farjadakbar4@gmail.com. You should receive a response within 48 hours.

### What to Include

When reporting a vulnerability, please include:

- **Type of issue** (e.g. buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
- **Full paths** of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
- **Location** of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- **Special configuration** required to reproduce the issue
- **Step-by-step instructions** to reproduce the issue
- **Proof-of-concept or exploit code** (if possible)
- **Impact** of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit it

### What to Expect

After you submit a report, we will:

1. **Confirm receipt** of your vulnerability report within 48 hours
2. **Provide regular updates** on our progress
3. **Credit you** in our security advisories (unless you prefer to remain anonymous)

### Security Best Practices

#### For Users

- **Keep your dependencies updated** - Run `npm audit` regularly
- **Use strong passwords** - Enable 2FA when available
- **Keep your environment variables secure** - Never commit `.env` files
- **Use HTTPS** - Always use secure connections in production
- **Regular backups** - Keep your data backed up

#### For Developers

- **Input validation** - Always validate and sanitize user input
- **Authentication** - Implement proper authentication and authorization
- **HTTPS only** - Use secure connections for all communications
- **Dependency scanning** - Regularly scan for vulnerable dependencies
- **Security headers** - Implement proper security headers
- **Rate limiting** - Implement rate limiting on API endpoints

## Security Features

### Authentication & Authorization

- **JWT-based authentication** with secure token handling
- **Role-based access control** (RBAC) for different user types
- **Session management** with secure session storage
- **Password hashing** using bcrypt with salt rounds

### Data Protection

- **Input validation** using Zod schemas
- **SQL injection prevention** through Prisma ORM
- **XSS protection** with proper output encoding
- **CSRF protection** with secure tokens
- **Data encryption** for sensitive information

### API Security

- **Rate limiting** on all API endpoints
- **Request validation** for all inputs
- **Error handling** without sensitive information leakage
- **CORS configuration** for cross-origin requests
- **API versioning** for backward compatibility

### Infrastructure Security

- **Environment variable protection** - Never expose secrets
- **Database security** - MongoDB with proper access controls
- **File upload security** - Validation and scanning of uploaded files
- **Logging and monitoring** - Security event logging

## Security Checklist

### Before Deployment

- [ ] All environment variables are properly configured
- [ ] Database connections use SSL/TLS
- [ ] API endpoints have proper authentication
- [ ] Input validation is implemented
- [ ] Error handling doesn't leak sensitive information
- [ ] Security headers are configured
- [ ] Dependencies are up to date
- [ ] No hardcoded secrets in code
- [ ] HTTPS is enabled
- [ ] Rate limiting is configured

### Regular Maintenance

- [ ] Run `npm audit` weekly
- [ ] Update dependencies monthly
- [ ] Review access logs quarterly
- [ ] Security testing annually
- [ ] Backup verification monthly

## Known Security Considerations

### Current Limitations

1. **File upload size limits** - Currently limited to 10MB per file
2. **Session timeout** - Sessions expire after 30 days
3. **Password requirements** - Basic password validation implemented
4. **Rate limiting** - Basic rate limiting on API endpoints

### Planned Improvements

1. **Two-factor authentication** - Planned for v1.1
2. **Advanced password policies** - Planned for v1.1
3. **Audit logging** - Planned for v1.2
4. **Advanced rate limiting** - Planned for v1.2
5. **Security scanning** - Planned for v1.3
